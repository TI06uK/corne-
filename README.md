# Keymap

Below is my current keymap for this board. There are 4 layers:

**Layer 0** (Default)

- QWERTY layout.
- Standard placement of Escape, L/R shift, Return, Tab.
- Equal & minus keys on the top right-most column on right hand.
- Backspace for the left hand pinky (in place of the usual capslock).
- Right main thumb is space, smaller thumb switches to layer 2.
- Left main thumb switches to layer 1, smaller thumb 1 is Command, smaller thumb 2 switches to layer 3.

**Layer 1**

- Right hand arrow navigation plus symbols `` :;|~`\ ``
- Right hand right-most column function keys are shortcuts to send specific strings (controlled by karabiner elements).
- Left hand has lots of typical shortcuts, e.g. cut-copy-paste, escape.

**Layer 2**

- Right hand shift-arrow navigation for selecting text
- Right hand right-most column function keys are shortcuts to launch specific applications or open finder to specific files (controlled by karabiner elements).
- Right main thumb is Command
- Left hand has a few other useful keys: brackets, left main thumb becomes command, tab under the pointer finger, and a few other shortcuts.

**Layer 3**

- Mouse keys on the right hand
